Ques: Create a new node for every node equal in value to it and inserted between itself and it's left child. 
		
 			a			a
   		     b     c     =====>      a     c
 					   b     c
                                         b
Solution: 
	Code Work in the post order.
Idea::  Assume that the left and right subtrees has done their work, afterwards.
        make a new node with same data as current node make the left side of subtree the left side of this node.
	Node newnode = new Node(current_node.data,ls,null);
	then connect the current node to the newnode. 
	our code is ready. 
	


public static Node leftClone(Node node){
		if(node==null){
			return null;
		}
		
		Node ls = leftClone(node.left);
		Node rs = leftClone(node.right);
		
		Node nn = new Node(node.data,ls,null);
		node.left=nn;
		node.right=rs;
		return node;
	}
