A height balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the height of the left subtree and right subtree of any 
node does not differ by more than 1 and both the left and right subtree are also height balanced.
 			| lsth - rsth | <=1


Solution: 
 
We will use the travel and solve technique here


static boolean isBalanced = true;
public static int isBalan(Node node){
	if(node==null){
		return 0; //height node wali cosnider kr rhe hai
	}

	int lh = isBalan(node.left);
	int rh = isBalan(node.right);

	int gap = Math.abs(lh-rh);
	if(gap>1){
		isBalanced=false;
	}
	return Math.max(lh,rh)+1;
