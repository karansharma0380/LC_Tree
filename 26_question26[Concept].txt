Question: Why only Full binary Tree for the construction of the tree using pre and post order Traversal.

Solution: The concept is that we can only contruct the binary is tree from given pre and post order traversal
	  when the binary tree is a complete Binary tree. 

e.g.
                         a
		      /     \
		    b         c			pre: a b d e i j c g h
		  /   \	    /   \	       post: d i j e b g n c a
		d      e   g      h
                     /   \	         	We will make the pre[0] root node, then 
	            i     j
